                                Dear Valued Customers,<br />
                                My name is Hossain MD. Sarwar Sunny, CEO of Japan Remit Finance Co, Ltd. <br />
                                The first time I was involved in a remittance business, dated back 15 years ago when I used to work for an international bank in Tokyo. <br />
                                At that time, honestly speaking, I was discouraged about how costly and inefficient the business was at the bank. <br />
                                Since then I had been anxious to seek more efficient ways of remittance to cater for those living here in Japan to send money home. <br />
                                I got to realize that the moment came, when I saw the Acts on Settlement legislated in 2010 in Japan.<br />
                                That was the reason why I decided to establish Japan Remit Finance Co., Ltd ("JRF"). <br />
                                JRF has been in the money transfer and currency exchange business for a couple of years and our business started from the scratch. <br />
                                Up to date, however, JRF has grown up to enable ourselves to remit to 83 countries due to tremendous supports from various parties. <br />
                                The size of global remittance market is said to be around USD 500 billion. <br />
                                Our future vision is to make JRF more and more global-oriented, and to make a social contribution <br />
                                and support to a social and informational minority, i.e. foreigners, living in Japan. <br />
                                I believe that JRF shall be a major global player as a company originated from Japan. Your continued support to JRF would be highly appreciated.<br />
